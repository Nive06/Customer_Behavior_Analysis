This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, transforming raw data into actionable insights through structured analysis and visualization. PostgreSQL was used as the primary database for 
storing, querying, and managing large datasets efficiently. Data processing and exploratory analysis were performed using Python with libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools within Jupyter Notebook. 
The prepared data was then connected to Power BI to build interactive dashboards and reports. Overall, the project demonstrates practical skills in data engineering, analysis, and business-focused storytelling using 
industry-relevant tools.
